# FileManagement

Purpose of the application: The main purpose of this web application is to provide a file management system for employees to access, download, and manage files. The application also has user authentication and authorization that allows for the secure access of user accounts with different access levels and provides a professional web interface for users to perform file operations. The project involved creating different servlets and JSP pages for different functionalities and integrating them together to create a functional web application.

Security Defense Strategies:
●	Role-based access control: The application has different types of users, and each type of user has different levels of access to the application's features. This is implemented using role-based access control to ensure that users can only access the features they are authorized to use.
●	Input validation: User input is validated on both the client and server-side to prevent injection attacks such as SQL injection and Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
●	Session management: The application uses session management to keep track of user sessions and to prevent session hijacking and other types of attacks.
